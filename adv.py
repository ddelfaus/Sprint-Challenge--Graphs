# There are a few smaller graphs in the file which you can test your traversal method on before committing to the large graph. You may find these easier to debug.

# Start by writing an algorithm that picks a random unexplored direction from the player's current room,
#  travels and logs that direction, then loops. 
# This should cause your player to walk a depth-first traversal. When you reach a dead-end (i.e. a room with no unexplored paths)
# , walk back to the nearest room that does contain an unexplored path.

# You can find the path to the shortest unexplored room by using a breadth-first search for a room with a '?' for an exit.
#  If you use the bfs code from the homework, you will need to make a few modifications.

# Instead of searching for a target vertex, you are searching for an exit with a '?' as the value. 
# If an exit has been explored, you can put it in your BFS queue like normal.

# BFS will return the path as a list of room IDs. You will need to convert this to a list of n/s/e/w directions before you can add it to your traversal path.

If all paths have been explored, you're done!
